In this sense, some new characteristics mark China's foreign trade.

First, the growth rate of its export will gradually slow down. Second, the quality of its exports will gradually increase and so will the price. China's trade growth rate is expected to be higher than global level, and China's share in world trade will continuously increase.

Third, China's new advantage in foreign trade will be in technology, brand, quality and service, rather than low prices. China should further optimize foreign trade structure. Foreign trade development should be more coordinated with national economic growth, environmental resource protection, industrial structure adjustment and regional development strategy.
